Hello,

Thanks for using my DM all you fucking sexy bitches. Make sure you install discord.js before running this shit.
After that, right click index.js open it as notepad and where it says PUT YOUR USERID HERE put your own userid.
After that, go to config.json and add your token and prefix.

Now run the launch file, and you're done.

Enjoy!
